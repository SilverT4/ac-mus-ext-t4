# Animal Crossing Music üçÄ (J variant)

**Animal Crossing Music** is a fun browser extension that lets you play Animal Crossing's music in the browser while you browse the web! ‚ú® 

The J variant was made after over 3 years of no upstream maintenance, and a strong love for Animal Crossing üíå

The music updates in real-time on the hour, and informs you via an optional desktop notification and customizable town tune! üå±

***The J variant of Animal Crossing Music is not associated with upstream.** Please do not go to PikaDude, anyone who works on the main project, or anyone in the Discord server, for any kind of support.*

## Features
### Hourly music üïí
Listen to the corresponding hourly music from the main Animal Crossing titles:
  - Animal Crossing
  - Wild World / City Folk
  - New Leaf
  - New Horizons

Raining and snowing variants are also included!

### Live weather üåß
If you enable the "Live Weather" function, weather variants of the hourly music will be automatically picked according to the weather in your specified location!

### K.K. Slider üéô
Listen to K.K. Slider's songs! The extension features both 'live' and 'aircheck' version of his tunes.

You can choose whether to keep his appearances to the usual Saturday nights, or to play his songs 24/7.

### Town tune üéµ
The extension features an awesome town tune editor available within the browser.

With it, you can compose your custom town tune! It'll be played every time an hour passes, just like in the games!

## Installation
### Stable release
Currently, there is no stable release. Please wait for a future update to this README.

### Other branches (using the source code)
You can download the source code of the project and install the unpacked extension yourself to access the latest, greatest and probably buggy unreleased features and updates. Just click on the `Code` button at the top-right of the page and then on `Download ZIP`.

To install the downloaded file as an extension, try the steps below.

**Note:** These instructions are for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Kiwi Browser, Opera, Opera GX, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.). The extension does work on Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers, but these instructions will be a bit different. (At the moment, it does not on Safari and other WebKit-based browsers.)
1. Unzip the downloaded file.
2. Get to the extensions page in your browser. 
   * Try visiting `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
   * If you still don't see it, try clicking on the three dots in the top-right of your browser. Look for `Extensions` somewhere.
      * It may be under `More Tools`, so try looking there if you don't see it.
   * In some browsers, it's out there front and center, and you can find it
3. Enable the `Developer mode` switch. 
4. Click on `Load unpacked`.
5. Choose the unzipped project directory.
6. Profit!

If you're having issues making the extension work with Opera GX or another Chromium-based browser, you may need to remove the following lines from `manifest.json`:
```json
   "optional_permissions": [
      "background"
   ],
```

If you're still having trouble, also try:
```json
   "browser_specific_settings": {
      "gecko": {
        "id": "{2fff585f-d956-4ea6-ba18-6fc7177f55a7}"
      }
   },
```

### Branch conventions
- The `stable` branch currently doesn't exist - but when it does, it'll contain the latest stable version of the extension, which you'll be able to find in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jbmagination/ac-music-extension-j/releases/latest). **Do not merge or make PRs here.**
- The `develop` branch contains the latest fully-integrated features of the extension. **This is where most PRs should be merged into.**
- The `upstream` branch contains the current latest code from `animal-crossing-music-extension/ac-music-extension`. **Do not merge or make PRs here.**
- There may be other branches that are used for feature development that may be too buggy and unstable to have on `develop`, or is simply being tested for another reason. You can find these branches by looking for the `exp/` before their name. **If you do PR to these branches, please note that they may be deleted at any time.**
